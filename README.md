## My Mission
### 2023
<samp>
For 2023, I am on a mission to solve each day's question in a new different language. <br>
My intention is to learn the basics and familiarize myself with languages that I dont use regularly or wish to learn. <br>
By the end of the season, I should have 31 Solutions in atleast 15 different languages.

Exams got in the way and i never could sit solve more problems in languages as just the parsing the input is a hassle in many programing languages given its massive size, structure and format. Many languages proved to be just functional and not viable be used for AoC like logic based scripting.
